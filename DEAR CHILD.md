## DEAR CHILD


Dear Child,
When God grants you peace, you don't call it fortune. You call it a blessing.


Dear Child,
God has already granted you joy. Whether you take it or not depends on you.

Dear Child,
There's a reason why Christ is called the Prince of Peace and not joy or success. It's because the ultimate reward the He offers is eternal peace in heaven.

Dear Child,
Life not only goes on after a tragedy. Life always goes on; be it in triumph or failure, good or bad times or even those times we don't know whether they are good or bad.

Dear Child,
The Truth will forever be hard and painful to bear. That's why for you to handle it the right way, you need Christ's Peace.

Dear Child,
Your greatest battle is your true calling. Therefore, take heart and soldier on for with God you've already won.

Dear Child,
There's a difference between a quiter and a person who has quit. Once I know it I'll let you know.

Dear Child,
If you as a person find God then whoever that person becomes, God will be glorified.

Dear Child,
The greatest inspiration, the greatest motivation isn't pain and suffering. It's peace.

Dear Child,
We don't thank God for success but for His merciful love and because He wills it.

Dear Child,
Many a times what makes a decision right isn't the decision itself but sticking to it.

Dear Child,
The greatest blessing that God can give you in your career is to make your passion and profession one.

Dear Child, 
No matter how much you save your talents, you'll never get a loan through them. So use them unsparingly.

Dear Child, 
One of the key aspects of wisdom is persperctive.

Dear Child, 
The only way peace can be found through war is in death.

Dear Child,
The hardest things have the greatest value.

Dear Child, 
Don't turn your personal issues into something greater than they really are and call it your choice.

Dear Son, 
This St Valentine's Day, just like every other day, put the MAN in RoMANtic.

Dear Child, 
When you celebrate life you won't need to worry about death.

Dear Child, 
It's called metamorphosis. Don't be disappointed with me for who I was yesterday. Afterall, you can't hate a butterfly because yesterday it was a caterpillar.

Dear Child, 
I pray that you come to know that you are more than you think you are.

Dear Child, 
If there's a difference between how you pray when you are need and when you have received, then you are not praying the right way.

Dear Child, 
Just because you can explain it, doesn't make it any less of a miracle.

Dear Child, 
When you become arrogant and overconfident, your strength becomes your weakness.

Dear Child,
When you know God's purpose for your life, your hard times become non-existent and your good times become sweeter.

Dear Child,
Christ is more than knowledge; He is Truth itself.

Dear Child,
Salary is the reward of solving problems.

Dear Child,
Enjoy the process, enjoy the time and enjoy the journey.

Dear Child,
Have you ever laid down your crown to serve God.

Dear Child,
Humility is when you have a choice. (A choice not a situation).

Dear Child,
Arrogance is built on ignorance.

Dear Child,
I've just realised that fulfillment is also a choice.

Dear Child,
The world celebrates you more in death than in life.

Dear Child,
Over the past few years, my perception of life has greatly changed and I know this is essential in my quest to be a Man.

Dear Child,
Challenges in life aren't there for us to prove ourselves but so that God's manifestations can be witnessed.(...so that you can witness God's manifestation in your life).

Dear Child,
A day has 24 hours not 12. Remeber that.

Dear Child,
We all submit to the Will of God.

Dear Child,
Great people in the Bible like Jesus and Job triumphed not because they asked for earthly blessings but because they submitted to God's Will.

Dear Child,
Putting others down doesn't mean or make you better than them. It just shows how unfulfilled you are.

Dear Child,
Don't lie to yourself. God owes you nothing. Come rain or shine, success or failure, good or bad and whether you like it or not, glory and honour shall be given unto Him. Now and forever.

Dear Child,
Another great realisation: Success is a choice.

Dear Child,
Not all monkeys are black.

Dear Child, 
Love is shown by doing more than what is expected.

Dear Child'
God raises you up not so that you look down upon others, but so that you can raise up others as well.

Dear Child,
Good people do exist and you have the golden opportunity of seeing one  when you look in the mirror but this depends on you.

The sooner you accept that it's all God's doing, the better, happier and more peaceful your life is going to be.

03/04/2021, 19:27: Dear Child,
Love is laying down your crown and humbling yourself. Love is leaving behind everything and committing to something greater than yourself. Thus I say, Dear Child, I love you.

07/04/2021, 19:59: Dear Child,
The reason why you lack peace is because you are living for this world. Remember, you don't belong to this world, Christ said so Himself.
