## DEAR CHILD


Dear Child,
When God grants you peace, you don't call it fortune. You call it a blessing.


Dear Child,
God has already granted you joy. Whether you take it or not depends on you.

Dear Child,
There's a reason why Christ is called the Prince of Peace and not joy or success. It's because the ultimate reward the He offers is eternal peace in heaven.

Dear Child,
Life not only goes on after a tragedy. Life always goes on; be it in triumph or failure, good or bad times or even those times we don't know whether they are good or bad.

Dear Child,
The Truth will forever be hard and painful to bear. That's why for you to handle it the right way, you need Christ's Peace.

Dear Child,
Your greatest battle is your true calling. Therefore, take heart and soldier on for with God you've already won.

Dear Child,
There's a difference between a quiter and a person who has quit. Once I know it I'll let you know.

Dear Child,
If you as a person find God then whoever that person becomes, God will be glorified.

Dear Child,
The greatest inspiration, the greatest motivation isn't pain and suffering. It's peace.

Dear Child,
We don't thank God for success but for His merciful love and because He wills it.

Dear Child,
Many a times what makes a decision right isn't the decision itself but sticking to it.

Dear Child,
The greatest blessing that God can give you in your career is to make your passion and profession one.
